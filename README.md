# Data-Analysis-of-Zomato

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and restaurant trends using data from Zomato. The goal is to uncover valuable insights into customer preferences, restaurant ratings, and ordering patterns. By utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis explores various aspects of the data, including identifying the most popular types of restaurants, examining the number of votes different types of restaurants have received, and analyzing restaurant ratings. Additionally, the project investigates spending habits, specifically focusing on the average amount spent per order by couples. It also compares the ratings of online versus offline orders to determine which mode has been rated higher and looks at which types of restaurants received more offline orders to help Zomato provide targeted offers. Through detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations, this project aims to provide actionable insights into Zomatoâ€™s customer and restaurant dynamics.
